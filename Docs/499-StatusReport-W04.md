**Number of hours worked since last update:** 9

**Number of hours worked on the project thus far:** 45

**Total number of hours anticipated for completion:** 130

**Accomplishments:**

* Created a "zig-zag" movement algorithm in order for the player character to move closer to the ball. Once closer, OpenCV has an easier time identifying the ball.

**Challenges:**

* Find a better way to move the player so that the webcam can detect the ball. If the ball is away from the player, the webcam will not detect the ball and the program doesn't know what to do.
* OpenCV identifies any spherical looking object as a ball, figure out how to filter out the non-ball objects or work around it.

**Plans / Goals for next week:**

1. Continue working on the synchronization between player movement and ball position
2. Figure out what to do when OpenCV detects the ball. Might have to use some math to figure out trajectory projections.

**Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)**

I will have my roommate make sure that I work on this at least 2 hours per day when I am not busy working on my other classes
