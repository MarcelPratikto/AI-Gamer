I know that the screenshot above doesn't do any justice, but I was able to accomplish the following:

* Complete the Requirements document
* Refine the AI-Gamer data processing
* Build up the dataset for ML model training

**Challenges:**

* Training the dataset is taking a long time, there is no shortcut to train the data to emulate my playstyle in Rocket League.
* I can now end the program through a button on the gamepad instead of switching programs. This allows for a better conservation of data to be stored on the dataset.
* The dataset is time sensitive.

**Plans / Goals for next week:**

1. Continue recording my gameplays into the csv file.
2. Start figuring out how to create and train a Multi-Output Regressor Machine Learning model.

**Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)**

I will have my roommate make sure that I work on this at least 2 hours per day when I am not busy working on my other classes
