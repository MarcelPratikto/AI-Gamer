**Number of hours worked since last update:** 9

**Number of hours worked on the project thus far:** 27

**Total number of hours anticipated for completion:** 130

**Accomplishments:**

* Got OpenCV working, and it is able to detect a ball in the game
* Tweaked the keyboard script since some buttons were not working correctly

**Challenges:**

* The script requires some fine-tuning for better movements in-game
* Combine OpenCV with the script to move the player character to a ball when it detects it
* Find a better way to move the player so that the webcam can detect the ball. If the ball is away from the player, the webcam will not detect the ball and the program doesn't know what to do.

**Plans / Goals for next week:**

1. Buy tripod for webcam so that it can face my screen and stay in the same position
2. Continue working on the synchronization between player movement and ball position

**Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)**

I will have my roommate make sure that I work on this at least 2 hours per day when I am not busy working on my other classes
