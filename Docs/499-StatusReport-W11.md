**Challenges:**

* The AI still behaves in a very basic way. I will have to keep training the dataset in order to make it "smarter" or figure out a different way to train it.

**Plans / Goals for next week:**

1. More dataset training.

**Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)**

I will have my roommate make sure that I work on this at least 2 hours per day when I am not busy working on my other classes
