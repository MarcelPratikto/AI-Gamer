**Number of hours worked since last update:** 18

**Number of hours worked on the project thus far:** 18

**Total number of hours anticipated for completion:** 130

**Accomplishments:**

* Created a script that can control the game without my input (I don't need to press any keys on the keyboard)

**Challenges:**

* The script only works for keyboard, not mouse
* The script requires some fine-tuning for better movements in-game

**Plans / Goals for next week:**

1. Buy tripod for webcam so that it can face my screen and stay in the same position
2. Start working on OpenCV to detect the ball in-game

**Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)**

I will have my roommate make sure that I work on this at least 2 hours per day when I am not busy working on my other classes

**Other comments:**

I didn't receive any reply on my project proposal yet, but I'm already this far into the project, so I will keep going
