**Number of hours worked since last update:** 9

**Number of hours worked on the project thus far:** 54

**Total number of hours anticipated for completion:** 130

**Accomplishments:**

* Changed controls from PyKey (keyboard) to PyPI's vgamepad (gamepad) for finer movements

**Challenges:**

* Upping the accuracy of OpenCV to 70% decreases the likelihood that a non-ball object is detected as a ball, the issue is that it also detects the ball fewer times than before
* OpenCV seems to detect the ball better when it's moving and struggles to detect the ball when it's still
* The inital detection when a new round starts is problematic as the ball doesn't move

**Plans / Goals for next week:**

1. Continue working on the synchronization between player movement and ball position
2. Figure out ball trajectory, and program a way for the player character to catch up to the ball

**Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)**

I will have my roommate make sure that I work on this at least 2 hours per day when I am not busy working on my other classes
